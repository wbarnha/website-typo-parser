# website-typo-parser
This is a program I wrote a long time ago in Python 2 to detect spelling errors on websites, particularly ones containing files in .xht format.
To install dependencies, simply run `./parsersetup.sh` or the provided `.zsh` file if you're running macOS. Then, simply run `python typoparser.py` and everything should be all set for you.
